## <a name="idea">The idea üí°</a>

This is so far the biggest project I've worked on by myself, besides the forums that have been very useful when I was confused, I've learned and reviewed a lot of concepts and technologies, **I hope you find it useful and learn something new from it too!**.

This project came up after finishing the video tutorial *[Build and Deploy a Full Stack Social Media App | React JS, Appwrite, Tailwind CSS, React Query](https://youtu.be/_W3R2VwRyF4?si=AqBk4i9-G28OfK0A)* After watching it, I continued with the second part of the tutorial on his blog *[JavaScript Mastery Blog
](https://www.jsmastery.pro/blog)*. In which I implemented many other features and had complications with others. Finally I tried to implement the original design *[made in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/TGm6gNug6PEwEbV8M0Kyll/JSM-YT---Instagram-Clone?node-id=0-1)*.

## Database Design

Appwrite uses a mix between NOSQL and SQL databases. It uses document-based queries as minimum units of information.

## <a name="the-design">The design üé®</a>

The design was made by [Adrian Hajdin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) and it's available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/TGm6gNug6PEwEbV8M0Kyll/JSM-YT---Instagram-Clone?node-id=0-1). The design is very well done and I tried to implement it as best as I could, but I had some difficulties with the design, so I made my own designs :^).

## <a name="the-tools">The Tools üõ†</a>

Originally, the project was built using the following technologies:

### Frontend

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/)

### Design

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/TGm6gNug6PEwEbV8M0Kyll/JSM-YT---Instagram-Clone?node-id=0-1)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

### Backend

This project uses Backend as a Service (BaaS) for the backend. The BaaS provider used is [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/).

## <a name="features">New Features ‚≠ê</a>

The [original features](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/social_media_app?tab=readme-ov-file#-features) were implemented in the project, but I also added some new features, such as:

ü§ú **Integrated chat**: You can now chat with other users, create, delete and edit messages, as well as view the number of unread messages.

ü§ú**Many more post and ...videos?**: You can now upload videos or images in formats validated in the forms. **You can upload up to 10 multimedia contents :^)**.

ü§ú **Improved UI**: New button layouts, new ShadCN components, new interactions and animations. Updated UI considering small, medium or large screen devices.

ü§ú **Are you online**: Online or offline status is updated **only** at login or logout.

ü§ú **Followers**: You can now follow users and be followed by others.
