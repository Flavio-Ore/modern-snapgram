## <a name="idea">💡 Idea</a>

Explore social media with this user-friendly platform that has a nice look and lots of features. Easily create and explore posts, and enjoy a strong authentication system and quick data fetching using React Query for a smooth user experience.

This was created as a part of my web development journey, and I learned a lot from this project. I hope you find it useful and learn something new from it as well.

### Design 🎨

The design in the tutorial was incomplete.
